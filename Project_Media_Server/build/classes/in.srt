93
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,640
If anyone asks in future
about your marriage,

00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,280
Oh no don't ask about it,

00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:19,440

jumping, firing,

96

it'll be kick to you and the listener.

97
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,200
Don't tell your children stories
about crows and foxes.

98
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,200
Tell them your marriage story,
it'll give them kick.

99
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,480
Hey! Had we been caught
we would've lost lives.

00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,000
Useless life! What if it's lost!

101
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,000
Can we get kick if we fear for that?

102
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:39,400
I can't take it anymore.

103
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:44,520
Brother, it's not important
why you did all this,

104
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:48,840
I was sad for eloping to marry
without my mother,

105
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,600
but now with your grace,
I don't have that worry too.

106
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,800

107
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,720
May God bless you with life long kick!

108
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:05,640
Even rogue elephant will
calm down on seeing me.

109
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:10,320
You made me run on streets
like a dog.

110
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:15,760
I'll not spare you,
I'll make you fall at my feet.

111
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:20,240
Don't taunt and make
a saint into roaring lion,

112
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,920
don't make me show my other face,

113
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,440
even if you think, it can't happen,

114
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,440
because I've only one face!

115
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:33,040
Did you expect punch dialogue, sister?
That's not my character. Bye sister.

116
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,400
Who is he?

117
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,000
Will he play with other's lives
for his kick?

118
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,280
Is he human?

119
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,840
You got this doubt if he's human now,

120
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:01,000
No, one new it's his first kick

121
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,360
This is his thrill

122
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,600
It was in his mother's stomache

123
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,880
It was a normal delivery
at the hospital

124
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,160
He was not normal
but born up side down

125
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,480
He was making the doctor smile

126
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,800
When kid's had bottle in there mouth

He use to use laptop
and type upside down

132
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,120

133
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,360

Is everyone in the famiIy a drunkard?

00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,240
Very naughty.

245
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,320
My husband is getting
ruined because of him.

246
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,560
He not an idiot either.

247
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:53,040
He stood first in schooI,
Inter, Engineering coIIege.

248
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:56,640
First in everything.
He is not Iazy too.

249
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:00,240
One day, he came to me saying he
got a job with Rs.50000 saIary.

250
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,480
I feIt very happy.

00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
He said that he has
Iost kick in thatjob.

254
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,400
He keeps taking up jobs
and resigning next day.

255
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,920
Neither I understand him
nor his kick.

256
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,880
I thought he wiII change
if he marries.

257
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,600
PeopIe who know this idiot wiII
not give their daughter to him.

258
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,360
Even our reIatives have
stopped visiting us,

259
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:19,120
fearing that we might
seek an aIIiance.

260
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:45,200
I want to see him settIe in Iife.

00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:49,160
His heart is very good

276
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:55,360
What is this kick?

277
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:59,680

282
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:18,800

Don't fear it will be easy
to find a job

290
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:28,280
The next day he worked
at a chemical lab

291
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:31,600
His experiment's was very weired

292

293
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:36,400

294
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:44,560
He could mix amd match anything

295
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,920
He should get the kick
While i get the shock

296
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:56,080
He is my inspiration

297
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:07,120

What is your plan

325
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:13,320
He must come for his gift

326
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:29,320
You shot him
But lucky he escape

327
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:31,720

Find out were he is from

335
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:14,360
Dehli police got some information

The entire police force in search

337
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:44,080

01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:00,360

Thank you for helping me?

356
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:29,360
Partner? Who is your partner?

357
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:30,960
You heIped me in robbing, right?

358
01:07:31,160 --> 01:07:33,840
ActuaIIy I knew that Minister's
money is with the peon.

359
01:07:34,040 --> 01:07:36,720
After I made you my partner in
the pIan and you caught him,

360
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:38,320
I came to know
where's the money,

01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:41,000
it means I made you aIso
my partner in the crime, right?

of the booty, partner?

You're making a grave mistake
by making me your partner.

365
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:52,360
You became my partner the day
you shot a buIIet into me.

366
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:57,360
If I had been your partner I wouId've
shot the buIIet into your heart.

367
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:08,400
You should be at the olympic's

368
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:12,440
You Iike chaIIenges.

369
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:14,800
You can guess it from my
modus operandi, say something new.

370
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:16,840
Your body can bear anything.

371
01:08:18,040 --> 01:08:20,560
You can say it Iooking at my body,
say something new.

372
01:08:20,760 --> 01:08:23,000
You trust your sense of timing,

373
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:24,800
you're cocksure nobody
can catch you,

374
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:28,160
above aII you're good in
making caustic remarks.

375
01:08:30,040 --> 01:08:33,520
You can judge it from my words,
say something new, partner.

376
01:08:33,720 --> 01:08:38,400
If my guess is right, you're near by,
Iooking at me whiIe speaking to me.

377
01:08:43,240 --> 01:08:45,200
Your guess is perfectIy right.

378
01:08:46,040 --> 01:08:47,720
One more thing,
you're the best one to catch me,

379
01:08:48,280 --> 01:08:52,480
but do remember one thing,
I'm aIways top and you're aIways down.

380
01:08:53,240 --> 01:08:56,640
You can never catch me.

381
01:08:56,840 --> 01:09:01,480
You've hurt my ego unnecessariIy,
and chaIIenged me,

382
01:09:01,760 --> 01:09:05,760
wherever you may hide,
I'II hunt you down.

383
01:09:05,960 --> 01:09:09,120
How can you catch me, partner?
Do you know how do I Iook Iike?

384
01:09:09,320 --> 01:09:10,240
You don't know.

385
01:09:10,680 --> 01:09:12,880
Do you know where wouId I be?
You don't know.

386
01:09:13,280 --> 01:09:15,640
Do you know who's next victim?
You don't know.

387
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:17,520
Do you know where
wouId I be tomorrow?

388
01:09:38,360 --> 01:09:41,000
You don't want to meet the
character in your story,

389
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:44,400
but I want to meet the
character in my story,

390
01:09:48,720 --> 01:09:50,640
He is nearby

391
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:53,040
This time he can't escape

392
01:10:02,160 --> 01:10:04,080
I will get him

393
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:17,040
Madam

394
01:10:26,120 --> 01:10:28,040

396
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:02,560
Whom did you see?

397
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:04,960
Devi

398
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:08,320
He ignored me

399
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:17,440
What is he doing here!

400
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:27,520
He came for a treatment

401
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:29,920
What problem he has

402
01:11:46,680 --> 01:11:48,600
He can be better

403
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:55,800
Can i take him home

404
01:12:00,120 --> 01:12:02,040
He can gain memory lost

405
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:07,320
Were is he?

406
01:12:56,720 --> 01:12:58,600
Yes

407
01:12:59,080 --> 01:13:01,000
Shaina

408
01:13:08,200 --> 01:13:10,120
Dr gave me your case to handle

409
01:13:18,280 --> 01:13:20,200
Actually we met before

410
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:33,160
Someone no's me

411
01:13:33,640 --> 01:13:35,560
I thought i was alone

412
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:38,880
Come along with me to my home

413
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:43,200
You can gain old memory lost

414
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:19,160
I can enter her house

415
01:14:19,640 --> 01:14:21,560
Devi will complete his job

416
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:09,320
Are you a patient

417
01:15:12,680 --> 01:15:14,600

His the same kick guy

419
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:30,880
His memory is lost

420
01:15:34,240 --> 01:15:36,160
Why did you bring the memory card home

421
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:38,560
To gain his memory back

422
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:42,880
My dream's compltely broke

423
01:16:22,680 --> 01:16:24,600

Have some important work to attend

427
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:13,520
Both are after each other

428
01:18:43,160 --> 01:18:45,080
Shiv you can't die

429
01:19:21,040 --> 01:19:22,960
15 minutes i can stop my breath

430
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:27,280
I can escape death for few minute's

431
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:35,440
Why this drama

432
01:20:11,400 --> 01:20:13,320
I won't tell you any information

433
01:20:17,640 --> 01:20:19,560
I don't have enough time
So as your death

434

He already planned his next

439
01:22:24,240 --> 01:22:26,160
Let's see who is the devil

440
01:23:16,520 --> 01:23:18,440
Hello partner

You going to be in jail

442
01:26:03,360 --> 01:26:05,280
Why did he call me in here

443
01:31:10,760 --> 01:31:12,680

Nothing like that to happen

448
01:32:55,760 --> 01:32:57,680
I don't drink as well

449
01:33:08,720 --> 01:33:10,640
Let me have one shot

450
01:33:25,480 --> 01:33:27,400

455
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:28,040
You are very beautiful...

456
01:39:31,480 --> 01:39:32,800
She belong's to you

457
01:39:37,520 --> 01:39:40,760
India's health care is
in his hands..

458
01:40:03,160 --> 01:40:04,600
I've killed thousands..

459
01:40:06,400 --> 01:40:08,560
Because I don't have enough
medicines in my possession..

460
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:13,240
neither the latest technology..

461
01:40:14,200 --> 01:40:15,160
Absolutely true..

462
01:40:15,800 --> 01:40:16,920
You're amazing..

463
01:40:19,040 --> 01:40:20,520
Who is this?

464
01:40:20,520 --> 01:40:24,400
With both hands,
I greet you..

465
01:40:26,400 --> 01:40:28,440
I'll lift you and
place you on my shoulders..

466
01:40:29,440 --> 01:40:32,880
and I'll kiss both your cheeks..

467
01:40:34,080 --> 01:40:36,600
I'll pull you closer and dance with you

468
01:40:41,120 --> 01:40:44,400
What Uncle..
we were having fun

469
01:40:48,840 --> 01:40:50,600
Devi I need to talk to you..

470
01:41:15,960 --> 01:41:16,840
Who are you looking for?

471
01:41:16,840 --> 01:41:17,800
Nobody..

472
01:41:49,840 --> 01:41:53,720
Why did the world health standard
reject your medicines and machines?

473
01:41:53,720 --> 01:41:56,760
We are here..
We will sort everything..

474
01:42:07,560 --> 01:42:10,840
Yes speak Shekar..
-Sir, the bracelet belongs to a girl named Shaina.

475
01:42:10,840 --> 01:42:11,800
What?

476
01:42:18,560 --> 01:42:22,200
Yes speak Shekar..
-Sir, the bracelet belongs to a girl named Shaina.

477
01:42:22,200 --> 01:42:26,240
What?
-Yes sir, the high commissioners daughter

478
01:42:29,720 --> 01:42:32,040
Shaina gave Devil the bracelet
as a gift..

479
01:42:34,720 --> 01:42:36,400
What is the connection between
Shaina and Devil?

480
01:42:43,960 --> 01:42:45,920
My lifes biggest tragedy..

481
01:43:45,080 --> 01:43:46,280
Congratulations partner..

482
01:43:47,640 --> 01:43:49,840
I told you Devil will
definitely come..

483
01:43:54,560 --> 01:43:56,440
To protect her ex - boyfriend..

484
01:44:07,920 --> 01:44:13,320
I don't know about Devil..
but Devi won't shoot Shaina..

485
01:44:13,320 --> 01:44:20,560
If you don't know, then look into
my eyes and tell me who is inside..

486
01:44:20,560 --> 01:44:25,360
Devi or Devil..

487
01:50:12,320 --> 01:50:13,640
I've had enough..

488
01:50:45,120 --> 01:50:48,040
I know that my son is the Devil..

489
01:51:16,560 --> 01:51:19,960
My name is Anil Singh..
and this is my wife Nandini..

490
01:51:19,960 --> 01:51:23,320
We live life happily on
a salary of 3 thousand

491
01:51:24,600 --> 01:51:27,000
and we share this happiness
with our daughter Jhumki..

492
01:51:27,880 --> 01:51:31,040
Our little family
and our little dreams..

493
01:51:36,160 --> 01:51:37,360
Everything was perfect..

494
01:51:38,640 --> 01:51:43,040
One day Jhumki fell unconscious..
We rushed her to hospital..

495
01:51:43,600 --> 01:51:46,520
The doctor said that
Jhumki had a tumor..

496
01:51:46,520 --> 01:51:50,560
She didn't have much time and we needed
to get money urgent for the treatment..

497
01:51:50,600 --> 01:51:54,480
We sold Nandini's jewelry
to get the money..

498
01:52:02,320 --> 01:52:03,880
Jhumki was our life..

499
01:52:03,880 --> 01:52:07,640
and if we lost our life,
how were we to live?

500
01:52:09,400 --> 01:52:11,120
our strength was finished..

501
01:52:11,120 --> 01:52:14,160
Maybe in our death,
we would find new a life..

502
01:52:14,160 --> 01:52:18,640
She is in St Marys Home..
Please save her..

503
01:53:10,120 --> 01:53:14,160
Father, how much money
do we have in the bank?

504
01:53:36,560 --> 01:53:39,160
What if Jhumki dies?

505
01:53:39,160 --> 01:53:41,520
There is one thing
we can do..

506
01:53:43,840 --> 01:53:46,120
We have a trust..
Angel health care..

507
01:53:52,560 --> 01:53:54,120
Hey make it fast..

508
01:53:54,120 --> 01:53:56,520
Yes Sir..
-Humans are not mannequins..

509
01:53:58,080 --> 01:54:00,000
How long must I hold
this titanic pose.. Quickly..

510
01:54:01,280 --> 01:54:02,880
Sir, I studied one case..

511
01:54:13,240 --> 01:54:14,240
Who's child is it?

512
01:54:14,240 --> 01:54:17,400
Your relative..
-No sir, not my relative..

513
01:54:20,440 --> 01:54:22,120
Sir you have many charitable trusts..

514
01:55:33,400 --> 01:55:35,800
10 thousand.. Are you mad?

515
01:55:42,280 --> 01:55:48,080
Remember I told you that you
would come begging at my feet one day..

516
01:56:09,160 --> 01:56:12,040
Today who won?
Me or him..

517
01:57:37,640 --> 01:57:42,160
At least give a smile..

518
01:58:34,080 --> 01:58:35,080
Look how happy they are..

519
01:58:45,080 --> 01:58:50,520
But think about it.. the whole city..
the whole state.. the whole country

520
01:58:50,520 --> 01:58:53,480
How  many kids suffer ?

521
01:58:56,440 --> 01:58:58,080
I will get all the childrens lists

522
01:59:12,800 --> 01:59:16,080
Everywhere I'm asked..
What gives me this kick?

523
01:59:16,960 --> 01:59:19,800
Think, From where did I get that kick?

524
01:59:19,800 --> 01:59:22,760
from a small childs smile..

525
01:59:24,160 --> 01:59:27,040
If 1 smile gives me such a kick..

526
01:59:28,640 --> 01:59:32,920
How many kicks would I get
from a thousand smiles?

527
01:59:38,280 --> 01:59:40,640
Where are we going to get so much money?

528
01:59:44,080 --> 01:59:47,000
from the same place this came..

529
02:00:01,240 --> 02:00:03,040
But he was going to shoot me..
-No my child...

530
02:00:07,400 --> 02:00:10,000
He will never do that..

531
02:02:29,520 --> 02:02:35,880
I get my kicks from victory..
but losing kicks are not that bad..

532
02:03:38,600 --> 02:03:41,440
Don't be afraid..
they don't know who you are..

533
02:04:15,360 --> 02:04:17,200
its the answer to my childrens future..

534
02:04:20,760 --> 02:04:21,600
You will die..

535
02:04:21,600 --> 02:04:23,480
Then on the 14 November
I will die..

536
02:04:23,480 --> 02:04:27,520
but on the 15 of November,
I'll join you..

537
02:04:27,520 --> 02:04:29,880
and you won't be able
to do a thing about it.

538
02:04:32,200 --> 02:04:34,680
14 November

539
02:04:40,840 --> 02:04:43,960
Come on .. make it fast
quickly quickly..

540
02:04:50,360 --> 02:04:51,760
Are you mad?
can't you see?

541
02:05:01,600 --> 02:05:03,360
Don't fool around..
not today..

542
02:05:06,520 --> 02:05:08,800
I know..
He will come..

543
02:05:08,800 --> 02:05:09,760
He will definitely come..

544
02:05:49,720 --> 02:05:50,560
now watch the fun..

545
02:09:40,960 --> 02:09:42,480
I always win..

546
02:10:10,840 --> 02:10:12,040
Who are you?

547

548
02:11:43,520 --> 02:11:44,880
As you sow..
so shall you reap..

549
02:11:44,880 --> 02:11:47,960
All the treatments will be free..
absolutely free..

550
02:11:50,520 --> 02:11:54,280
All the money that comes..
will be spent on the children only..

551
02:12:38,320 --> 02:12:40,640
My king..
-Speak my king..

552
02:12:40,640 --> 02:12:48,280
You take the van and go..
while I take the police on a joyride..

553
02:14:13,240 --> 02:14:13,960
Whats happening here?

554
02:14:13,960 --> 02:14:16,160
Today is 14 November
Childrens day..

555
02:14:59,200 --> 02:15:07,400
Everything is over..

556
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:09,120
He is going to handle the Devil case..

557
02:16:09,800 --> 02:16:11,640
I know him..
-Hmm

02:16:13,040 --> 02:16:15,720
I'm sure I know you..
-I doubt it partner

559
02:16:15,720 --> 02:16:20,520
Because I don't forget
a case or a face..

560
02:16:22,360 --> 02:16:23,440
What is this new drama?

561
02:16:23,440 --> 02:16:25,760
Its not a drama..
Its a kick..

562
02:16:25,760 --> 02:16:27,240
Didn't I tell you..

563
02:16:27,240 --> 02:16:29,320

564
02:16:29,320 --> 02:16:33,840

and you won't be able to do a thing about it.

565

567
02:16:49,040 --> 02:16:53,720
Partner, I was never against you..

568
02:16:55,240 --> 02:16:56,920
It was all about the children..

569
02:16:56,920 --> 02:16:59,800
Women and work..
You took both away..

570
02:16:59,800 --> 02:17:01,360
